  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Tries to read the next packet from the socket. If mode is :nonblock (the default), this will not block and will return nil if there are no packets waiting to be read. Otherwise, this will block until a packet is available. Note that some packet types (DISCONNECT, IGNORE, UNIMPLEMENTED, DEBUG, and KEXINIT) are handled silently by this method, and will never be returned.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: If a key-exchange is in process and a disallowed packet type is received, it will be enqueued and otherwise ignored. When a key-exchange is not in process, and consume_queue is true, packets will be first read from the queue before the socket is queried.
