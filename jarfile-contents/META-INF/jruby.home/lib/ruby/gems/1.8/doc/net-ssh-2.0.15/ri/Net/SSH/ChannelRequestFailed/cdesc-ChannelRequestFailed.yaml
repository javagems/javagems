    body: This exception is primarily used internally, but if you have a channel request handler (see Net::SSH::Connection::Channel#on_request) that you want to fail in such a way that the server knows it failed, you can raise this exception in the handler and Net::SSH will translate that into a &quot;channel failure&quot; message.
