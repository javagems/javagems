  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Requests that a pseudo-tty (or &quot;pty&quot;) be made available for this channel. This is useful when you want to invoke and interact with some kind of screen-based program (e.g., vim, or some menuing system).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Note, that without a pty some programs (e.g. sudo, or subversion) on some systems, will not be able to run interactively, and will error instead of prompt if they ever need some user interaction.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Note, too, that when a pty is requested, user's shell configuration scripts (.bashrc and such) are not run by default, whereas they are run when a pty is not present.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  channel.request_pty do |ch, success|\n    if success\n      puts &quot;pty successfully obtained&quot;\n    else\n      puts &quot;could not obtain pty&quot;\n    end\n  end\n"
