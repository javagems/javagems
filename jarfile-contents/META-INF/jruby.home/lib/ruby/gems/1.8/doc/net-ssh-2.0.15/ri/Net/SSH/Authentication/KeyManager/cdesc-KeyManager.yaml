  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This class encapsulates all operations done by clients on a user's private keys. In practice, the client should never need a reference to a private key; instead, they grab a list of &quot;identities&quot; (public keys) that are available from the KeyManager, and then use the KeyManager to do various private key operations using those identities.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The KeyManager also uses the Agent class to encapsulate the ssh-agent. Thus, from a client's perspective it is completely hidden whether an identity comes from the ssh-agent or from a file on disk.
