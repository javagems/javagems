    body: This is an abstract class, not to be instantiated directly, subclassed by Net::SSH::Test::LocalPacket and Net::SSH::Test::RemotePacket. It implements functionality common to those subclasses.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: These packets are not true packets, in that they don't represent what was actually sent between the hosst; rather, they represent what was expected to be sent, as dictated by the script (Net::SSH::Test::Script). Thus, though they are defined with data elements, these data elements are used to either validate data that was sent by the local host (Net::SSH::Test::LocalPacket) or to mimic the sending of data by the remote host (Net::SSH::Test::RemotePacket).
