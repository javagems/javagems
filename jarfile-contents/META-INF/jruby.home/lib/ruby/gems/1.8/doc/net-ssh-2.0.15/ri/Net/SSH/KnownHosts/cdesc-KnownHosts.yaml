  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Searches an OpenSSH-style known-host file for a given host, and returns all matching keys. This is used to implement host-key verification, as well as to determine what key a user prefers to use for a given host.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This is used internally by Net::SSH, and will never need to be used directly by consumers of the library.
