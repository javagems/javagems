    body: "This is called internally as part of #process. It dispatches any available incoming packets, and then runs Net::SSH::Connection::Channel#process for any active channels. If a block is given, it is invoked at the start of the method and again at the end, and if the block ever returns false, this method returns false. Otherwise, it returns true."
