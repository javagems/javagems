If the <tt>options</tt> hash includes an :ssh key, the value for that will be passed to the SSH connection as options (e.g., to set the password, etc.). All other options are passed to the #download! method. If a block is given, it will be used to report progress (see &quot;Progress Reporting&quot;, under Net::SCP)."
