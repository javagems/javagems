    body: Raised when the cached key for a particular host does not match the key given by the host, which can be indicative of a man-in-the-middle attack. When rescuing this exception, you can inspect the key fingerprint and, if you want to proceed anyway, simply call the remember_host! method on the exception, and then retry.
