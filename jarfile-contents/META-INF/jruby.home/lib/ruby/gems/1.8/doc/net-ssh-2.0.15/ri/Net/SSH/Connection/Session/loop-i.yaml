    body: "The main event loop. Calls #process until #process returns false. If a block is given, it is passed to #process, otherwise a default proc is used that just returns true if there are any channels active (see #busy?). The # <tt>wait</tt> parameter is also passed through to #process (where it is interpreted as the maximum number of seconds to wait for IO.select to return)."
