    body: This is exception is primarily used internally, but if you have a channel open handler (see Net::SSH::Connection::Session#on_open_channel) and you want to fail in such a way that the server knows it failed, you can raise this exception in the handler and Net::SSH will translate that into a &quot;channel open failed&quot; message.
