  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Syntactic sugar for requesting that a subsystem be started. Subsystems are a way for other protocols (like SFTP) to be run, using SSH as the transport. Generally, you'll never need to call this directly unless you are the implementor of something that consumes an SSH subsystem, like SFTP.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
    body: "  channel.subsystem(&quot;sftp&quot;) do |ch, success|\n    if success\n      puts &quot;subsystem successfully started&quot;\n    else\n      puts &quot;subsystem could not be started&quot;\n    end\n  end\n"
