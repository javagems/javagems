    body: "Starts up a new SSH connection using the <tt>host</tt> and <tt>username</tt> parameters, instantiates a new SCP session on top of it, and then begins an upload from <tt>local</tt> to <tt>remote</tt>. If the <tt>options</tt> hash includes an :ssh key, the value for that will be passed to the SSH connection as options (e.g., to set the password, etc.). All other options are passed to the #upload! method. If a block is given, it will be used to report progress (see &quot;Progress Reporting&quot;, under Net::SCP)."
