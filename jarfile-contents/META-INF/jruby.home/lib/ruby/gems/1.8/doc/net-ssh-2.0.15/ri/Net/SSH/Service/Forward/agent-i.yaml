    body: "Enables SSH agent forwarding on the given channel. The forwarded agent will remain active even after the channel closes--the channel is only used as the transport for enabling the forwarded connection. You should never need to call this directly--it is called automatically the first time a session channel is opened, when the connection was created with :forward_agent set to true:"
