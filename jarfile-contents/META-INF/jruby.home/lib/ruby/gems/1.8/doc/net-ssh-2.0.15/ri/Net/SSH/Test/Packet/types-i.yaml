  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Returns an array of symbols describing the data elements for packets of the same type as this packet. These types are used to either validate sent packets (Net::SSH::Test::LocalPacket) or build received packets (Net::SSH::Test::RemotePacket).
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Not all packet types are defined here. As new packet types are required (e.g., a unit test needs to test that the remote host sent a packet that is not implemented here), the description of that packet should be added. Unsupported packet types will otherwise raise an exception.
